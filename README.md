React Dashboard powered by Tailwind CSS

I have also used RECharts to retender graphs. It is basically a library which helps us to build easy and customiable graph.

To Login/SignUp AUTH0 is used. It redirect you to login/signup page when you click either
"Login with Google" or "sign up" or "register".
Form you is dummy just UI. But you can click buttons to get redirected to another page from where you can login

To manage data I will use Graph CMS API.

I will also use Google Cloud API to to login-logout.
