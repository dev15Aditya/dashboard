React Dashboard powered by Tailwind CSS

I have also used RECharts to retender graphs. It is basically a library which helps us to build easy and customiable graph.

To Login/SignUp AUTH0 is used. It redirect you to login/signup page when you click either
"Login with Google" or "sign up" or "register".
Form you is dummy just UI. But you can click buttons to get redirected to another page from where you can login

I am using this free API 'https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/languages'
This API endpoint returns the languages used in the Facebook React repository on GitHub along with the number of bytes of code written in each language. You can use this endpoint to extract information about the most and least used languages in the repository.
